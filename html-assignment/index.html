            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm 19 years old, and am a first year student at <em>Algonquin College</em> in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>. I enjoy drawing, reading, writing, and taking nature photos. I live in rural Ontario with my family, it's a very small town where everyone knows each other. I'm related to most of the people in the area as well, I have a big family and we enjoy spending time together.
            </p>
            <P>
                I work at a library one town over from where I live, I work 10 hours a week, all year long. This is my 5<sup>th</sup> year working there, my job is to be there when the actual library is not open, so that the community has access to internet and the printer all week long.
            </P>
